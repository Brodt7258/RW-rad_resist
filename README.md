Rimatomics is great. Other mods adding armor are great. This mod is designed to make them work together a bit more seemlessly.

I didn't love that radiation resistence can only be found on the gear provided by Rimatomics. Entirely understandable why that's the case,
but I wanted to make a small contribution toward a more seemless and immersive Rimworld experience. I don't think there's a good _in game_ reason why other hazmat suits shouldn't have the stat too.

I've also added it to vanilla power armor, and its derivatives from Vanilla Armour Expanded and Spartan Foundry. It seems reasonable to me that super-advanced full-body glitterworld
armor should provide decent rad protection. I've kept the values similar to the Rimatomics resistances, except for the Hazardous Operations Armor, which is a bit higher because it's
supposed to be specialized for roles such as this, and Light Marine Armor, which is quite a bit lower because it is (presumably) less shielded, and not fully enclosed.

Also, add toxic resistance to power armors. Only makes changes if it hasn't already been done by another mod. If it has, the patch should bail out and defer to whatever is already there.
