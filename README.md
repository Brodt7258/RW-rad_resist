Rimatomics is great. Other mods adding armor are great. This mod is designed to make them work together a bit more seemlessly.

I didn't love that radiation resistence can only be found on the gear provided by Rimatomics. Entirely understandable why that's the case,
but I wanted to make a small contribution to a more seemless and immersive experience. I don't think there's a good _in game_ reason why other hazmat suits shouldn't have the stat too.

I've also added it to vanilla power armor, and its derivatives from Vanilla Armour Expanded and Spartan Foundry. It seems reasonable to me that super-advanced full-body glitterworld
armor should provide decent rad protection. I've kept the values similar to the Rimatomics resistances, except for the Hazardous Operations Armor, which is a bit higher, because it's
supposed to be specialized for roles such as this.
